# Sensibo Thermostat Card

A thermostat-style Lovelace card for [Sensibo](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensibo/) AC controllers with a dedicated power button, mode and fan control, mode-tinted backgrounds in three selectable styles, first-class support for Sensibo's native off-timer — set it, watch it count down, and let the device switch itself off — and a built-in **Climate Assist** toggle that runs a local, subscription-free re-creation of Sensibo's Climate React.

The built-in thermostat card can't show Sensibo's timer, gives no at-a-glance indication of the running mode, and turning it "on" means hunting through mode buttons. This card fixes all three.

## Features

### Power, mode and fan — console style

- **Dedicated power button.** On/off lives on its own button, separate from mode selection — one obvious tap, styled after a real AC controller. The button fills when running.
- **Stage settings while off.** Tap a mode or pick a fan speed any time. While the unit is off the selections are simply staged (and highlighted); hitting power applies them. While running, changes apply immediately.
- **Mode buttons.** A round-button row for every HVAC mode the device reports — cool, heat, dry, fan-only, and heat/cool (labelled **Auto**). The section label always shows the current selection.
- **Fan speed dropdown.** Built from the device's actual `fan_modes` (quiet, low, medium, medium-high, high, auto, strong — whatever your unit supports).
- **Target temperature** with +/− controls that respect the device's min/max and step, plus live current temperature and humidity readouts.

### The off-timer

- **Timer dropdown appears when the unit is running**, sitting beside the fan dropdown. Intervals and maximum are configurable (default: 10-minute steps up to 4 hours).
- **Arms automatically at power-on** at a configurable start value (set it to 0 to disable auto-arming), using Sensibo's native `enable_timer` — the schedule lives on Sensibo's cloud, so the AC turns itself off even if Home Assistant is down at the time.
- **Live countdown** in the timer label while running.
- **Change it mid-run** — picking a new duration re-arms the timer; picking Off cancels it without stopping the AC.
- **Powering off manually resets the timer.** No orphaned schedules.

### Climate Assist — a local Climate React

Sensibo's own Climate React (keep the room inside a temperature band by cycling the AC) is now a paid subscription. Climate Assist re-creates it **locally in Home Assistant**, for free, with a set of automations you build once — the card just gives you the switch and the thresholds.

- **One-tap toggle**, shown beside the controls whenever the unit is on. It's bound to the Sensibo **Climate React switch** (`switch.*_climate_react`), so flipping it here or in the Sensibo app is the same state — the two stay in sync.
- **Low / high thresholds** appear while Assist is on and adjust in 0.5° steps straight from the card, writing to the threshold entities so the automation and the app read the same numbers.
- **Logical on-state.** While Assist is on the card presents the AC as **on** — power button lit, mode colour held — even when the engine has cycled the physical compressor off between threshold crossings. A subtle indicator shows what the hardware is actually doing: **Assist · cooling** vs **Assist · idle**.
- **Power-off does the right thing.** Tapping power turns Assist off *first* (so the engine can't immediately switch the unit back on) and then the AC — one beep, no fight.

The card supplies the controls; the cycling logic lives in HA automations (one per AC) that you set up separately — see [Climate Assist setup](#climate-assist-setup) below. If you don't wire a react switch, the toggle simply doesn't appear and the card behaves exactly as it always has.

### Looks

- **Three styles, selectable in the GUI editor** (same convention as [airtouch-card](https://github.com/mycrouch/airtouch-card)):
  - `default` — no gradient; the card follows your installed HA theme.
  - `bold` — deep mode-tinted gradients with white text.
  - `pastel` — soft mode-tinted gradients with dark text.
- **Mode-tinted background** — heat, cool, dry, fan-only and auto each get their own colour, with a smooth cross-fade on change. Individual mode colours can be overridden in YAML.
- **Off keeps the last mode's colour** — like the AirTouch console, only the power button reflects the off state, so the card never flashes grey.

### Engineering niceties

- **Minimal IR commands = minimal beeps.** Power-on is sent via `sensibo.full_state` — one API call carrying the complete AC state, so the AC beeps once, not twice (`climate.set_hvac_mode` from off makes two API calls in the Sensibo integration). Mode or fan selections that match what the device is already doing send nothing at all, and the timer never sends IR.
- **No scroll-jump, no flicker.** The DOM is built once and updated in place, and a short optimistic hold after a power press smooths over the Sensibo cloud's state-bounce (on → stale off → on).
- **Zero-config entity wiring.** The timer switch and end-time sensor are derived automatically from the climate entity ID. Overrides available for exotic setups.
- **Full GUI configuration** — appears in the card picker with a visual editor for entity, name, style, and all timer settings.

## Requirements

The official [Sensibo integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensibo/), which provides the `climate.*` entity plus the `switch.*_timer` and `sensor.*_timer_end_time` entities this card uses.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. HACS → menu (⋮) → **Custom repositories** → add `https://github.com/mycrouch/sensibo-thermostat-card`, category **Dashboard**
2. Download **Sensibo Thermostat Card** (the Lovelace resource is registered automatically)
3. Hard-refresh your browser

### Manual

1. Copy `sensibo-thermostat-card.js` to `/config/www/`
2. Add a dashboard resource: URL `/local/sensibo-thermostat-card.js`, type **JavaScript module**

## Configuration

Everything is configurable in the GUI editor (**Add card → Sensibo Thermostat Card**). YAML equivalent:

```yaml
type: custom:sensibo-thermostat-card
entity: climate.dining_room_sensibo_living_area
name: Living Area          # optional, defaults to the entity's friendly name
style: pastel              # optional: default | bold | pastel
default_minutes: 60        # optional, timer armed at power-on (0 = none)
interval_minutes: 10       # optional, timer dropdown steps
max_minutes: 240           # optional, timer dropdown maximum
# Climate Assist (all optional; derived from the entity slug by default)
react_switch: switch.dining_room_sensibo_living_area_climate_react
react_low: input_number.climate_assist_living_area_low
react_high: input_number.climate_assist_living_area_high
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `entity` | required | Sensibo `climate` entity |
| `name` | friendly name | Card title |
| `style` | `pastel` | `default` (follows theme), `bold`, or `pastel` (`light` accepted as an alias) |
| `default_minutes` | `60` | Timer value armed at power-on, in minutes; `0` = no timer |
| `interval_minutes` | `10` | Timer dropdown interval |
| `max_minutes` | `240` | Timer dropdown maximum |
| `timer_options` | generated | Explicit list of minute values (overrides interval/max) |
| `timer_switch` | derived | Override the `switch.*_timer` entity |
| `timer_end` | derived | Override the `sensor.*_timer_end_time` entity |
| `react_switch` | `switch.*_climate_react` | Switch the Climate Assist toggle binds to (shared with the Sensibo app) |
| `react_low` | `number.*_climate_react_low_temperature_threshold` | Low-threshold entity; point at an `input_number` when using local helpers |
| `react_high` | `number.*_climate_react_high_temperature_threshold` | High-threshold entity; point at an `input_number` when using local helpers |
| `colors` | built-in | Per-mode CSS background overrides, e.g. `heat: "linear-gradient(145deg,#fdd,#fba)"` |

The threshold steppers appear only when `react_low` / `react_high` resolve to a **writable** entity (`number` or `input_number`). If they point at a read-only `sensor` (or aren't set), the toggle still works but the numbers are hidden.

### Timer behaviour in detail

The timer dropdown is hidden while the unit is off. Powering on from the card arms Sensibo's native off-timer at `default_minutes` and the label becomes a live countdown. Changing the dropdown mid-run re-arms at the new duration; selecting Off cancels the timer while the AC keeps running; powering off manually cancels and resets it. Because the schedule runs on Sensibo's cloud rather than in Home Assistant, the shutdown fires even if HA is restarting.

Powering on from the Sensibo app or an IR remote does not arm the timer — if you want that, pair the card with a small automation that calls `sensibo.enable_timer` when the climate entity leaves `off`.

## Climate Assist setup

The card renders the Climate Assist controls, but the actual thermostat cycling is done by Home Assistant automations you create once per AC. The card only needs three things to exist:

1. **A toggle switch** — the Sensibo integration's `switch.*_climate_react` works perfectly. Without a Climate React subscription the native switch does nothing on Sensibo's side, so it's free to use as a plain on/off flag that's shared with the app. (`react_switch`.)
2. **Two writable thresholds** — Sensibo exposes the Climate React thresholds as **read-only** `sensor.*_climate_react_*_temperature_threshold` entities, so create an `input_number` per AC for the low and high setpoints (0.5° step) and point `react_low` / `react_high` at them.
3. **An engine automation** per AC that, while the react switch is on, watches the Sensibo climate entity's `current_temperature` and:
   - powers the unit **on** with a single `sensibo.full_state` call (one IR blast, one beep) when the room crosses the far threshold, and
   - powers it **off** with `climate.set_hvac_mode: off` when it reaches the near threshold,
   with a `for:` dwell (e.g. 5 minutes) on the temperature triggers for compressor protection, `mode: single`, `max_exceeded: silent`.

Pair it with a small companion automation so that if the AC is switched off by anything *other* than the engine (the Sensibo off-timer, a manual/app power-off), the react switch is turned off too — distinguish the engine's own power-off via the state-change context (`trigger.to_state.context.parent_id`) so normal cycling isn't interrupted.

> **If you later subscribe to Sensibo Climate React**, disable the HA engine automations (or the native React) — otherwise both engines will act on the same AC and fight each other.
